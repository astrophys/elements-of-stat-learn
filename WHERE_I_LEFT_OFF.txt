Did:
1. Removed swapping columns for boundary after N-neighbor search
2. Added euclidean_dist() and order_points() to overcome ugly boundary
   due to misordered points

To Do:
1. The problem is with trying to find the line boundary between the two groups
   the matrix[] looks roughly of the same form.
2. There is a goofy oscillation due to multiple switches across a matrix[:,j] 
   j-column.
