Did:
1. bayes_classifier() -> bayes_classifier_NOT_FUNCTIONAL(). I need to do 
   a better job trying to reproduce Figure 2.5

To Do:
0. The bayes' classifier returns a shit line boundary. THIS NEEDS FIXED!!
   --> After playing with gnuplot and the output of plot_bivariate_gaussian()
       I believe that I'm not getting the Baye's boundary correctly.  I really
       need to follow the algorithm laid out on p16-17 of Hastie. I'm perplexed
       by the comment that the boundary is 'completely known'. I don't believe this
       b/c I don't know the 'm_k' that they picked.
1. Create ability to generate plots like Hastie fig 2.3.  This would required 
   substantial effort in identifying 'islands'
2. Create ability to generate the data hastie did for Fig 2.1,2.2, and 2.3.
   Generate 10 means from bivariate distribution for blue, do same for orange.
   For each observation, draw randomly from one mean and then use it to seed 
   the Gaussian.
